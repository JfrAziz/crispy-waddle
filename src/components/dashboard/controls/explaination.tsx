        Social economics is primarily concerned with the interplay between
        social processes and economic activity within a society. Social
        economics may attempt to explain how a particular social group or
        socioeconomic class behaves within a society, including their actions as
        consumers. According to BPS Statistics Indonesia, low socio-economic
        fulfillment indicates poverty. Thus, socioeconomic data is important to
        read market needs to maximize sales. On the other hand, this data is
        also needed to show the incidence of poverty. However, traditional data
        collecting implies that socioeconomic data is only presented at the
        district level and updated once a year. This research aims to develop
        the granular socio-economic mapping based on remote sensing and other
        geospatial big data and present it in the form of a website-based
        dashboard enriched by insight into consumer behavior modeling and
        consumer behavior geographical factor analysis. This approach allows for
        presenting more granular socioeconomic data in terms of coverage and
        time at a cheaper cost and faster rate. To overcome this, we integrate
        multisource remote sensing satellite imagery and other geospatial big
        data by implementing artificial intelligence-machine learning and
        statistical analysis. The novelty of this research is the innovative
        advancement of remote sensing technology to improve market business
        strategy and poverty alleviation insights at the same time.
